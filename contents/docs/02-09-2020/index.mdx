Paul and I walked around the garden twice today after the rain had eased up and took photos for the website. Many plants are in bloom, and many of the flowers were holding pristine drops of silver water. Truly, _rahma_ is everywhere.

So much happens each day, and I have so little to say about it.

After our walk, we sat on the benches near the pond and I fell into deeper meditation. It was around sunset, so I began doing _Maghreb_ in my imagination - not moving a muscle, but carefully following each incantation and embodied movement through its proper course. What it felt like to move through each cycle!

Paul looked at me afterwards and called it “windows into Reality”, which was both perfectly timed and about as well put as it can be. It’s like being totally transparent.

The sense of overwhelming light, being broken into a release and relief beyond measure, and then the completely full compassion required to come back and keep pretending: there is no way to quantify all this in any sentence.

We walked home quietly and made some coffee. The full moon finally broke through the clouds right as we stepped out of the kitchen, steaming cups cradled in our hands.
