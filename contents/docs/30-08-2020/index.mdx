No meeting with SFH today, but things continue to unfold in unexpected and delightful and challenging ways. David brought croissants over this morning for breakfast. It’s funny how Paul tries to avoid him - I suppose that some of his preaching can get tiresome once you’ve known him for a longer time. Still, it seems strange to speak badly of others, particularly other close students on your path. 

I enjoyed what he had to say about the fractal nature of trees and lightning and the veins in our body and how the kind of self-similarity behind all of these natural structures hints very directly at an underlying pattern. He also said the most beautiful thing to me, a quote he had remembered from somewhere:

*"Love what you love \
in moderation \
for it may become what you hate. \
Hate what you hate \
in moderation, \
for it may become what you love."*

We discussed how intimate and impersonal the whole thing is, which left us both stunned and silent and singing joyously simultaneously.

Later in the day, I went to visit Mary and we worked a little more on the website. I think we’ve found a great picture for the “About” page, and a slowly improving structure for the videos section. We’re also working on a callout style for short aphorisms or sayings from SFH, so that we can weave a golden thread of his living words through the whole thing: an idea I deeply resonate with. It’s an honour to spend time with Mary: she has such presence and poise, and is full of strange and wonderful stories. She also said she’d give us some of the rose geranium oil SFH doused us with yesterday. Like I said: it is unexpectedly delightful here.
