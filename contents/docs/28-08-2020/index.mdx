description: Jackson's Grapefruit and Rose Geranium

Paul and I went for another evening walk after a day of reflection and work and literally the best crumble and custard I have ever had for lunch. Mary continues to outdo herself. We were a little bit later today on account of all these Jim Al-Khalili documentaries we’re watching for the Quantum Mechanics work, but soon ran into SFH, Alethia and Aaron on their own stroll. We joined them.

SFH was talking about how anything we do for others is really an act for ourselves. This links to honesty in a deep way: after all, what is the other but a mirror for the self? Alethia and Aaron joked with Paul about being “Mahaguru”, which I think is hilarious. It was just another completely joyous meeting.

We walked for some time together, and SFH pointed out a White (or Jackson’s) Grapefruit tree, which he told me to pick a few fruits from. The first I gave to Paul, and then I took one for myself, which I offered to SFH who took it, held it for a moment and then returned it. Aaron also picked a few, so we now have a bunch of these amazing fruits in our kitchen.

SFH talked at length about, in particular, the antibacterial properties of the seeds and how they’re increasingly used in all kinds of modern medicines, even in the West. He said, “The next generation is already protected to ensure it will grow as the fruits pass on.” This struck me as a particularly powerful and profound metaphor. 

We walked a little further and admired Jupiter and the waxing moon, which are in increasing alignment. I remembered my dad talking about how this alignment between Saturn, Jupiter and the Moon only happens once every ~40 years. Alethia and Aaron seemed confused about whether Jupiter was a planet, star or satellite, but asked Google as is the modern trend. My concern is simply being fully present with SFH. These times together are unspeakably full.

We walked on, and he spoke a little about how close to Kruger this place actually is - 20km as the crow flies - and asked about the duikers who tend to hang out around Andalus. We eventually ended up on his veranda again and he showed me how to cut one of the grapefruit most efficiently. You put the head (where it connected to the stem) downwards and cut it in half from the bottom. Then into quarters, and use the leptin gathered at the head to peel the quartered section easily. It was entirely delicious.

We just stood around speaking about this and that. Most of the conversation centred on essential oils and the perfume industry. SFH had stressed yesterday how he tries to only use South African oils, and was lamenting the fact that the international markets - Europe especially - tend not to. Apparently, South African farmers are not reliable or consistent enough, though the wealth of flora and the amazing conditions in this country make it a perfect place for growing. 

He mentioned, in particular, that South African lavender is considered too strong in the perfume world, so it gets labelled lavendine and given a low grade. He also mentioned Karen Swanepoel (who Mary knows well) and Denzel Phillips, both of whom are experts in the field. Karen had got hold of 5kgs of some really special South African Rose Geranium, which Mary had bought. SFH had a small bottle of it, which he fetched and doused all of us in. The scent is genuinely remarkable. As is so often the case in this man’s presence, words fail to even come close to what it really is.

Eventually, we all went our different ways, and Paul, Alethia and I ended up on the benches in the garden absorbing each other’s presence and the atmosphere of the farm. Alethia shared some amazing and surprising music, which prompted Paul to share some of his own, and we just sat in bliss saying a few things every now and then, but mostly just loving the feel of being with like-hearted human beings.
