description: Owls, Omsapoortie, and Macadamias
---

Paul and I went on an early evening walk through the macadamia groves here - it was great to be out and about, though Paul seemed to be in a bit of a rush and we walked briskly through the bigger-than-expected plantation.

We then went across to the farm and walked almost directly into Alethia and SFH. SFH gave each of us some white blossoms he had picked which he said we could eat. They smell heavenly, and taste OK, though I think definitely better to breathe in than consume. Then he pointed upwards into the tree where both Spotted Eagle Owls were sitting, watching these strange humans with detached interest. 

He distinguished between the male and female (who is bigger) and talked a little bit about how he thinks they’re finally getting ready to nest. He chuckled when talking about how the male had tried the previous evening, and the female had seemed kinda into it, but then had flown away with these “big eyes”, mimicking her uncannily.

Alethia then took a call and SFH, Paul and I walked out in the wider gardens. He took us to a specific tree on the property which he called “Omsapoortie”, though I cannot find any reference to such a thing online. He said it was a kind of South American fruit tree, and pointed out the fruits (which are all still green at this time of year). Paul said they are something like custard pears, or a cross between apples, mangos and avocados. Sounds heavenly. SFH said there used to be 4 on the property, but now there is just one left.

SFH then had us gather some macadamias lying on the floor beneath some of the other trees to take back to his veranda so he could show me how to crack them. As we walked back, he spoke about this world being the “second womb”, after the mother’s womb. We are here to learn in this nursery all the different forces of consciousness, all the pushing and pulling so that we might perfect our surrender and prepare for the pure witnessing he spoke about previously.

He reflected on the work he has asked us to do, speaking about how these scientific models can help people overcome the superstition and tendency towards embellishment that you find in religious narrative. We all like to mythologise. 

“We’re always after power, and this has been the West’s great downfall. No respect for the life we all share: it’s all about my life and your life and their life. It is just life!” 

We must keep finding clear, simple and direct means of expressing this so as more people can come to live it, even if they are not raised with this awareness in their culture. The scientific model is a good one for this, but only when coupled with “reverence for the Absolute”. I can’t quite describe what it felt like to hear those words from his mouth: it is a truly lived experience.

By this stage, we had made it back to his balcony and he had me sit down right where he cracks macadamias. He joked about his “high tech, laser setup” which consists of using the gaps between the floor tiles and a big, flattened stone which fits perfectly into the palm. He asked Paul if he should take me on as an apprentice, to which Paul (bless his heart) responded in the affirmative. 

The first nut I cracked I did a little too hard, but I got the second one right. These ones had been drying for a few days in the sun, which makes cracking them easier, though the ones we had gathered still have a lot of moisture in them, and the kernel presses right up against the shell. Strangely enough, the really fresh ones seem to have a hint of a coconut taste to them, which SFH commented on.

We fed a few to the dogs, who are apparently mad for macadamias, and then just sat in bliss. SFH spoke a little bit more about the work and the overall, simple package he wants to produce which can be passed from person to person. It is paradise to be with this man. There is no need to say anything, no questions spring to mind, no desire for anything but to live each moment I get with him fully and in total presence.

Mary joined us and we spoke a little about the dogs, and all the people that have been here today, and America and various other light topics. Again though, it was just the joy of being together which overwhelmed all other considerations.
