Paul and I took the dogs for a walk again around sunset, circling the property three times. He pointed out a number of fruit trees to me - jackfruit in particular, as well as taking me into the mango grove. We picked up two avos up from the floor and generally revelled in the abundance of this place. On our third round, we saw SFH and Aaron on their own perambulation and left them to it.

We went looking for the spotted eagle owls, who nest in a dead tree directly outside SFH’s house, but couldn’t find them on this occasion. We also hung out with some of the blooming flowers in the garden. They remind me somewhat of rose geraniums, but are something different and less fragrant. Paul also can’t remember the name of the ayurvedic plant SFH pointed out, though it seems to grow in the courtyard at Andalus too. I suppose we will just have to accept our floral limitations for the moment and keep appreciating the beauty as best we can.

As we came round the house on our final perambulation, we found Mary feeding the dogs and Aaron, Alethia and SFH seated quietly in the garden. We greeted Mary and joined the other three. SFH began by talking of the relief encoded in _Allahu akbar_, and what it is to accept and submit to this cosmic declaration, knowing that it is always already greater than anything you can know or think.

Of course, to realise and live this, rather than just hold it as an idea in your mind, requires work: the so-called grooming of the self. Everyone will experience this to the degree appropriate in their life and, even if you don’t realise it while living, you will after death. So don’t worry too much, but balance this with whatever work you can handle, ever seeking subtler shades of self-knowledge.

SFH then began to talk about his current investigations, which have to do with a number of _ayat_ in the Qur’an on the topic of _shirk_, which is “the dark side of _tawhid_”: seeing anything other than Oneness at any time. With deeper shades of self-knowledge comes appreciation of the lights which create them, and then the lived experience of their total lack of separation. It is One.

We then just spent some time relaxing together. Mary joined the party and we talked about the dogs and various other ordinary and wonderful things. Alethia even interrupted SFH at one stage, which surprised me, but it was also entirely delightful to see him as a man, relaxing with some close friends, rather than only as a teacher, demanding that everyone listen. 

At one stage, Aaron took Paul and I to look for the owl again, which we did, but were still unable to spot either male or female. SFH had been speaking at lunch two days ago about how their language changes when they’re courting, which is currently underway, and he seems to stand on his veranda and engage them in active conversation - something I find both amusing and profound. They are such amazing birds, and it is a testament to the nature of this place that they are so comfortable with nesting right next to where he lives.

Eventually Aaron and Mary left to attend to their respective duties, and SFH said a few more words to us. The dogs were getting a bit rowdy and we were seated on the floor, so all I remember of that particular burst was that it was a continuation about only seeing Oneness and _Nur al an-Nur_: light upon light, which seemed entirely appropriate given the way the half-moon and light from the house behind us was reflecting off the dog’s glossy fur, the ridge - as Aaron had pointed out - like an alif right down the middle of their backs.

SFH then rose to leave, we rose to greet him, and he shared a little bit more information about some street vendors nearby whom we should visit to buy some fruits: they are apparently the only people he buys from. He noted, in particular, their faith and trust.
